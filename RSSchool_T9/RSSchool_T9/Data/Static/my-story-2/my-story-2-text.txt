Music is life
Life, life, life
Come again
E-li-phant
Holla at me hater, I'mma holla back
See me cut a dread in a disco track
Beer's on ice, soon as I'm home
Roll up a shrink now my beer is cold
I put my headphone on, make a blood beat
And soon I'mma zone, I'mma groovin'
Gotta keep groovin', gotta groove for life
Riddim's mi window, it's me hope, it's me life
I gotta stay true yo, visitors free
I gotta hold on now, this time is me
And my man Ras G, hey - if he cook a rock, serve a melody
Ey yo oh - Gotta keep movin', and groovin' for life, for life
Ey yo oh - this type of music keep me groovin' for life, for life
Music is life
E-e-e-elliphant
Anotha day anothda dollar say
Waking up, waking down, wanna fly away
Who are you big G, I never saw you bro
You like a brush in my eyes, a-a-alright
Good vibes the people them want
Play the music an tell me' ya can't
From Jamaica, Sweden to France
People, I jump an' prance
It's a source of life
Take it from the word of the wise
When I down an' out and I need some strength
Music can keep me alive
Ey yo oh - Gotta keep movin', and groovin' for life, for life
Ey yo oh - this type of music keep me groovin' for life, for life
Music is life
Feel no pain, ah
Blood run tru' my vein, ah
Feel so good, ah
In my neighborhood
Breathe in, breathe out and feel the love, G
You may be poor but music is free
A shitty day but then you press play
Music will take you away
Ey yo oh - Gotta keep movin', and groovin' for life, for life
Ey yo oh - this type of music keep me groovin' for life, for life
Ey yo oh - Gotta keep movin', and groovin' for life, for life
Ey yo oh - this type of music keep me groovin' for life, for life
Music is life
You gotta keep movin' boy
You gotta keep movin' gal
You gotta keep movin' up
You gotta keep movin' a movin' a move
